Binary-Clock
============

Binary clock in bash for *nix. Made mostly for use with GeekTool on OSX

This is a binary clock that displays time in HH/MM/SS format.

In the script you can change:
- 12 hour to 24 hour format
- Color for both on and off lights
- Symbols that represent on or off

This clock works best with a monospaced font. I used Monaco.

* For use with GeekTool *
- just make the geeklet command: /path/to/binary_clock.sh

You may have to 'chmod a+x binary_clock.sh' to make it run.
